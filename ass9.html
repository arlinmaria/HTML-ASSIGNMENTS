<h3>COMPUTER</h3>

<br>
<br>

A computer is a general purpose deGce that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily  changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem. 
<br>

<h4> <a id="cpu"> cpu </a></h4>
<br>

A central processing unit (CPU), also referred to as a central processor unit, is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instmctions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system. The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s. The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fimdamental operation remains much the same 


<br>
<h4> <a id="alu"> ALU </a></h4>
<br>

In computing, an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that perfortns integer arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer, and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers. The processors found inside modem CPUs and graphics processing units (GPCs) accommodate very powerfull and very complex ALUs; a single component may contain a number of ALCs.
